Optional: Create map.txt containing map data (layout in Controller.cpp)
Start program
Select TSP or maze
Click load map or generate map (latter does not require map.txt), loading a TSP map when maze is selected of vice versa may break things
Pick behaviours
Set values of parameters
Click update (may need to click this after selecting new map/behaviours even if values didn't change, possible bug)
Click run
See output.txt for results in form
